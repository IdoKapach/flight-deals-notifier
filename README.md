# Flight deals notifier ✈️

## This project tracks flight deals (from amadeus.com) from London to various destinations that don't exceed a specified budget and sends notifications about those deals to users' emails.

The tracking process is based on a sheet file that contains information about the required flights, including the destination and the budget (the maximum price considered attractive for the flight to that destination).

Additionally, the project has access to a sheet file containing user information - their first name, last name, and email address. This allows the system to send personalized notifications to each user when an attractive deal is found. There is also an option to register new users to the list.
